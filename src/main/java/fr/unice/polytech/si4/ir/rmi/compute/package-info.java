/**
 * Designing a Remote Interface
 * At the core of the compute engine is a protocol that enables tasks to be submitted to the compute engine,
 * the compute engine to run those tasks, and the results of those tasks to be returned to the client.
 * This protocol is expressed in the interfaces that are supported by the compute engine.
 * The remote communication for this protocol is illustrated in the following figure.
